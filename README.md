# CFN Parameters extraction

This simple library takes your Parameters section from a JSON or YAML formatted CFN template 
and spits out a JSON file suitable to use for command line access. 

Literally, that's it. 

It's design to work in a web page or be called as a library

## How to use

1. Define a `<div>` with id = `app` (`<div id="app"></div>`)
1. add a script tag at the end of your HTML file: `<script src="bundle.js"></script>`
